| `Esc`    | Close picker              |

## ⚙️ Configuration

```lua
require("vim-coach").setup({
  -- Disable default keymaps
  -- Set vim.g.vim_coach_no_default_keymaps = 1 before setup

  window = {
    border = "rounded",
    title_pos = "center",
  },
  picker = "snacks", -- "snacks" (Default) | "telescope"
  keymaps = {
    copy_keymap = "<C-y>",
    close = "<Esc>",
  },
  user_commands = {} -- Custom user commands
})
```

### Disable Default Keymaps

If you want to set your own keymaps:

```lua
vim.g.vim_coach_no_default_keymaps = 1
require("vim-coach").setup()

-- Set your own keymaps
vim.keymap.set('n', '<F1>', '<cmd>VimCoach<cr>', { desc = 'Vim Coach' })
```

### 📋 Custom User Commands

1. A user can add their own commands or edit existing commands in the `user_commands` table in the plugin config.

2. Follow this format:

```lua
<category_name> = {
    {
    name = "Command Name",
    keybind = "key",
    modes = {"n", "v"},
    explanation = "What the command does",
    beginner_tip = "Helpful tip for beginners",
    when_to_use = "When this command is most useful",
    context_notes = {
        file = "Behavior in files",
        explorer = "Behavior in explorers",
    },
    examples = {"example1", "example2"}
    },
    ...,
},
...,
```

3. The `user_commands` table is merged with the default commands, so if a command already exists, it will be
   overwritten.

## 🎯 What Makes This Different?

Unlike other cheatsheet plugins, vim-coach.nvim provides:

### 📖 Comprehensive Explanations

```
Delete Line (dd)
├─ What: Deletes entire current line
├─ When: Removing code lines, empty lines
├─ Tip: Cursor can be anywhere on the line
├─ Context: In file: removes code | In explorer: may delete files
└─ Examples: dd, 2dd (delete 2 lines)
```

### 🧠 Beginner Coaching

- **WHY** use each command
- **WHEN** it's most effective
- **WHERE** it works (file vs explorer context)
- **HOW** it differs from similar commands

### 🔍 Smart Search

- Search by command name: "delete line"
- Search by keybind: "dd"
- Search by purpose: "remove text"
- Fuzzy matching finds everything
